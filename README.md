# S1Flow

S1Flow is a simple CSS/JS hack to render Salesforce Visual Workflow screens in Salesforce1 app using [Lightning Design System] styling

The CSS overrides the styling of various DOM elements that are auto generated by Visual workflow and the JS file is needed only if you use date fields. Otherwise, just using the CSS should do the trick

Please note that multi picklist are not supported yet.

### Version
1.0

### Usage

* Download the [s1flow.zip] file and upload it as static resource
* Then embed your flow in a Visualforce page as below
```sh
<apex:page standardStylesheets="false" showHeader="false" sidebar="false" >
    <apex:stylesheet value="{!URLFOR($Resource.s1flow,'s1flow.css')}" />     
    <apex:includeScript value="{!URLFOR($Resource.s1flow,'datehandler.js')}" />
    <flow:interview name="myflowcss"/>
</apex:page>
```
* Make sure the Visualforce page is set up as 'Available for Salesforce mobile apps and Lightning Page'
* Place this visualforce page in the Salesforce1 navigation menu or as a quick action
* Enjoy!
